# CS3642_Assignment-3
This assignment had two parts. 

The first part required that a perceptron be implemented to recognize 4 block images and determine if the image is bright or dark. 

The second part of the assignment required that a perceptron be implemented for a real-world application. I chose to implement a perceptron that determined whether or not a plant needed to be watered based on five binary environmental conditions.
