# CS3642_Artificial Intelligence 
These are the three assignments that I completed for my AI course. The folders contain the finalized project files. These files include the instructions pdf, requirements.txt, my final submission python file, a README, a gitignore, and other necessary files. 

## Assignment 1 
This assignment required the implementation of a model-based AI agent to carry out a simple task, and it required a finite state diagram. The agent that I implemented was a vending machine that sold 30 cent Coca Colas. The machine accepted inputs of Quarters, Dimes, and Nickels. 

## Assignment 2 
This assignment required that the UCS and A* algorithms are implemented to solve a randomly generated 8-puzzle. 

## Assignment 3 
This assignment had two parts. The first part required that a perceptron be implemented to recognize 4 block images and determine if the image is bright or dark. The second part of the assignment required that a perceptron be implemented for a real-world application. I chose to implement a perceptron that determined whether or not a plant needed to be watered based on five binary environmental conditions.
